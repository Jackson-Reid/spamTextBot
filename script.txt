Did you really think your joke was funny?
News flash, buddy, nobody's laughing.
In fact, I so happen to have a chart of the course of comedy in the past 50 years, at right at the end here is when you told your joke.
Wow the rate of comedy dropped by 99% percent!
You single handedly ruined humor as we know it.
I contacted a comedy scholar for analysis of your joke, Bartholomew DeJesus.
He gathered his team and used advanced quantum physics and technology to look into over half a million alternative universes where you told a joke, and analyzed them all.
Your joke was still the worst out of half a million possibilities.
Think of that!
The humor police have been called and there are over 50 available units en route to your location to restrain you from telling more horrible jokes and dooming humor as we know it, and the FBV are on their way to asses the vibe of the room and provide trauma relief and therapy for innocents that may have cringed too hard from your joke.
I would brace for the storm, man.
You are literally the most cringiest, unfunny human being alive, and when they put you into heavy cringe containment, you will be facing charges for aggravated cringe and 1st degree bad joke telling, both of which may be punishable by death.
Shouldn't have told that joke bro.
